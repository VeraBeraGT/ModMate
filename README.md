# ModMate

## What is it?
Itâ€™s a scriptable widget that displays your schedule for school, its basicly scheduler 2.0. Eventually it will be able to mark down assignments and do other things similar to what Saturn can do. But for now, it works. This is a kind of placeholder project for the app im going to make out of this. i hope to eventually obtain the WHS PowerSchool API. but for now, maunaul labor is required.


## How to get it?
First make sure you have the application **Scriptable** installed. Next go to releases, find the newest version and download the file called ModMate.shorcut. it should prompt you to add a shortcut to your device, accept this prompt. once you do, click on the new ModMate shortcut and it should start installing. for the record, this short cut is also an updater but ill make sure to post a new release every time i make a major update to the script. To update it, just run the script and if thier is an update, it will prompt you to update it.

## Setting up your classes
Once you finish installing it, head over to scriptable and find the script called ModMate and click on it. A menu will pop up and on that menu their is going to be a button called "Schedule", click it. Another menu should pop up with an add class button, click it then type in the name of your class and click save. now a menu should show up with the add class button and the class you just added. click on your newly added class and on the new menu click each of the days of the week and type in the mod num, 1-10. Don't worry about adding open mods or homeroom, those are already their. **make sure to click save changes at the bottom of the mod selection screen or else your stuff won't save**

## Adding the widget
Now that you have added all your classes you can click close if you still have the menu open and head to your homescreen. Click and hold on an empty space on your screen until the apps start to wiggle. Once they do, click the edit button in the top left of the screen, then click add widgets. click search and type in scriptable, then swipe over to the biggest widget and tap on it. place it down somewhere then tap on it, click on script and then click on ModMate. Then boom, enjoy ModMate.
